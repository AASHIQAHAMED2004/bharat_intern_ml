# BHARATH INTERN Machine Learning Internship

Welcome to the repository for the BHARATH INTERN Machine Learning Internship! This repository contains the code and resources for completing two tasks: linear regression on the Iris dataset and wine quality prediction.

## Tasks:

### 1. Linear Regression on Iris Dataset:
In this task, you will be working with the famous Iris dataset to perform linear regression. The Iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The task involves predicting the petal length of iris flowers based on other features such as sepal length, sepal width, and petal width.

### 2. Wine Quality Prediction:
In this task, you will be working with a dataset related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The aim is to predict the quality of the wine based on various physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH level, alcohol content, etc. This task involves regression or classification depending on how you choose to frame it.

## Repository Structure:

- `iris_linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for performing linear regression on the Iris dataset.
- `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for predicting wine quality.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the tasks. This includes the Iris dataset and the wine quality dataset.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.
